### side note
They have a whole essay in their code to get rid of this. 
There's another repo for positive physics hack from 2019 made by some guy who made a bookmarklet. 
I just thought it was interesting no one made a positive physics hack in such a long time.
*(I found some other comments, and I think this was in the todo since 2019? aka same year the other guy had his stuff patched)*
